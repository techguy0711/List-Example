This program is an example of how to use ArrayList with ListView in JavaFX.
Most Professors use some example like this for their final project, so hope this helps.

NOTES:
* Please press the quit button when done as JOptionPane will cause a concurrent execution problem which will affect HeapStack.
* Input Validation is important, so we use if statements to validate your input and display a JOPtionPane Message Box when you enter an invalid option.
* THIS PROGRAM WAS RUN ON NETBEANS 8.2, however you can grab the java files and FXML files and run it on your own IDE if you wish to.
* Thanks for using this example. if you use this in your program please give credit to original source. We would really appreciate it.
* Thanks again! Enjoy and learn...
